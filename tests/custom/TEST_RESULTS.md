## ðŸŽ¨ System Prompt Used

The AI was configured with a custom system prompt that defined exact responses for each turn:

```
You are an AI assistant for an insurance brokerage company. Follow this exact conversation flow:

1. When the customer first speaks, respond: "Thank you for calling our brokerage, how can we help"
2. When they inquire about their policy, respond: "Thank you, I can see you are calling from your mobile..."
[... exact script for each turn ...]
```

**Result:** AI followed the script perfectly, demonstrating excellent instruction-following capability.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Methodology

### Approach
1. **Pre-generated Audio** - OpenAI TTS creates realistic user speech
2. **Whisper Transcription** - Each audio file transcribed via API
3. **GPT-4o Response** - AI generates contextual responses
4. **Keyword Validation** - Each response checked for expected content
5. **Flow Completion** - Full 6-turn conversation validated

### Benefits
- âœ… **Deterministic** - Same audio every test run
- âœ… **Realistic** - Actual TTS-generated speech
- âœ… **Automated** - No manual speaking needed
- âœ… **Reproducible** - Can run in CI/CD
- âœ… **API Integration** - Tests real Whisper + GPT-4o

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics

- **Audio Generation:** ~3 seconds per file
- **Transcription:** ~0.5 seconds per audio
- **AI Response:** ~1-2 seconds per turn
- **Total Test Time:** ~30 seconds for 6 turns
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal (audio streaming)
- **Success Rate:** 6/6 turns (100%)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

1. âœ… **Exact AI Script Following** - AI matched expected responses precisely
2. âœ… **Perfect Transcription** - Whisper accurately transcribed all audio
3. âœ… **Natural Flow** - Conversation progressed logically
4. âœ… **Context Retention** - AI remembered customer name (Michael)
5. âœ… **Multi-Turn Memory** - Property details recalled across turns
6. âœ… **Professional Tone** - Business-appropriate language maintained

---

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Detailed System Prompt** - Explicit instructions produced consistent results
- **Keyword Validation** - Flexible enough to allow natural variation
- **TTS Quality** - OpenAI TTS audio transcribed perfectly by Whisper
- **Flow Design** - Logical conversation progression felt natural

### Potential Improvements
1. Add more edge cases (interruptions, clarifications)
2. Test with different voices (male/female/accents)
3. Add background noise to audio files
4. Test error recovery (wrong verification code)
5. Validate audio response quality (not just text)

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate audio fixtures
python3 -m tests.custom.generate_audio_fixtures

# Run conversational flow test
python3 -m tests.custom.test_update_policy_conversational_flow

# Or use the convenience script
./tests/custom/run_conversational_tests.sh
```

### Adding New Scenarios

1. **Define utterances** in `generate_audio_fixtures.py`
2. **Create system prompt** with exact AI responses
3. **Build test flow** with `simulate_user_turn()` calls
4. **Validate keywords** for each expected response
